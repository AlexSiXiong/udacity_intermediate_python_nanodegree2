# Meme Generator

The goal of this project is to build a "meme generator".

A multimedia application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote. Itâ€™s not that simple though! Your content team spent countless hours writing quotes in a variety of filetypes. You could manually copy and paste these quotes into one standard format.
